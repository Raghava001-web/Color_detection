# Color_detection
This project uses OpenCV and Python to detect the dominant color of objects you hold in front of a webcam. Instead of raw RGB values, it shows the actual color name (like red, blue, or black) and logs results with timestamps. If nothing is held, it responds accordingly, making computer vision fun and beginner-friendly.
